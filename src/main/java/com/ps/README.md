#### Interesting Code
An piece of code that I found interesting was the if statment in my code: 

default: System.out.println("Invalid Calculator");
                break;

I found this interesting because if the user puts an invalid choice it will print "Invalid Calculator" and this is done without the use of if/else statements.
